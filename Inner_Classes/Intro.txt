Java inner class or nested class is a class that is derived inside another class or interface.

syntax:
class Outer_Class {
    //code

    class Inner_Class {
        //code
    }
}


Advantages:
1. it can access all members/methods of outer class (private too).
2. it makes the code more readable and maintainable. (cuz it's logically grouped together)
3. code optimization: use less to write
