Polymorphism: it provides an ability to use same code in multiple ways.

1. Method Overloading: when a class has multiple methods with same name but different parameters.
2. Method Overriding: if subclass has the same method as declared in the parent class.
3. Covariant Return Type: It allows a method in a subclass to return a subtype of the type returned by the method in the superclass. This feature was introduced in Java 5.0.
4. super keyword: It is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.
5. Instance Initializer Block: it is used to initialize the instance data member.
6. final keyword: constant
7. Runtime Polymorphism: Upcasting and Downcasting
8. Dynamic Binding
9. instanceof Operator
