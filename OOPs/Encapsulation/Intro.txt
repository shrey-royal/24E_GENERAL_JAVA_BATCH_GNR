Encapsulation: It is a Process of wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit called class. It is a mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. In short, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.

Encapsulation can be done using: 
1. Access Modifiers (public, private, protected)
2. Accessors (getters) and Mutators (setters)
3. Packages
