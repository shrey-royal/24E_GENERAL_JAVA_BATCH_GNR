Abstraction : Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

Abstract Class: A class with the abstract keyword is called an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.

0%-100% abstraction is possible in abstract class.

Rules for Abstract class:

1. must declare with abstract keyword.
2. it can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
3. it cannot be instantiated. (we can not create objects of abstract class)
4. it can have constructors and static methods also.
5. it can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interface: Interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has final static constants and abstract methods only.

> 100% abstraction is possible in interface.


POints to remember:

1. Interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has final static constants and abstract methods only.
2. the data members of interface are public, static and final by default.
3. no need to use abstract keyword with methods.
4. it cannot be instantiated.
5. it can only be implemented by those classes which inherit it.
6. it cannot have constructors.
