> MultiThreading: It is a process of executing multiple thread simultaneously (parallely).

> Thread: A thread is a lightweight sub-process (smallest unit of processing), used to achieve multitasking.

> Thread uses a shared memory area.
> context-switching between threads takes less time than process.
> Used in games, animation, etc.

Advantages: 

> doesn't block the user.
> Threads are independent.
> perform multiple operations at a time.

Life Cycle of a Thread: (Thread States)

1. New : When a new thread is created
2. Active {start()} : runnable(waiting for cpu) / running(when thread gets the cpu)
3. Blocked/Waiting : Whenever a thread is inactive for a span of time(not permanently).
4. Timed Waiting : Whenever a thread is inactive for a speicific span of time.
5. Terminated : Whenever a thread has finished the execution or any unhandled exception occurs or the thread gets killed forcefully.
