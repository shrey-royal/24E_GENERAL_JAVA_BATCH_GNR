C   : Procedure Oriented Programming Language
C++ : Semi-Object Oriented Procedure Language
Java: Pure Object Oriented Programming Language

Java is a platform independent language. It means that we can write and compile the java source code in one platform (eg Windows) and can execute the class in any other supported platforms (eg Linux, Solaris, etc.).

Java is a platform also which means that we can create once and run anywhere.

Source Code : .java
Byte Code   : .class (Intermediate Code)

to compile the java code we use javac command: javac <filename>.java
ex: javac Hello.java

to run the java code we use java command: java <classname>
ex: java Hello

There are some rules to save the file name in java.

1. The file name should be same as the public class name.
2. The Class name should start with a capital letter and should be in camel case and also doesn't contain any special characters or spaces.

class HighSchoolStudent{}  //valid
class High_School_Student{} //valid
class High School Student{} //invalid - error
class highSchoolStudent{}  //invalid
class HighschoolStudent{}  //invalid


In Every java program there should be atleast one public class.


filename: A.java
public class A {}
public class B {main}   //error: class B is public, should be declared in a file named B.java


Source Code (java file) : Basic.java

javac Basic.java -> Basic.class  (Byte Code)

java Basic (classname) -> Output

Access Modifiers : public, private, protected, default
1. public : The class, method, variable, constructor declared as public can be accessed from anywhere.
2. private : The class, method, variable, constructor declared as private can be accessed only within the class.
3. protected : The class, method, variable, constructor declared as protected can be accessed within the class and outside the class but through inheritance only.
4. default : The class, method, variable, constructor declared as default can be accessed within the class and outside the class but within the package (same directory) only.

without importing any packagename we can't use the classes of that package.
